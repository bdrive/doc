1. Log in with Team Admin ID and go to MERMERS tab of [**https://accounts.bdrive.com/plans_products/NetDrive3/team**](https://accounts.bdrive.com/plans_products/NetDrive3/team).

2. Add Team members 

   * Team Admin may add Bdrive email IDs of each of Team members.

   *	Each member needs to [**Create Account IDs**](#wiki-toc-create-account-id) in [**https://accounts.bdrive.com/accounts/signup**](https://accounts.bdrive.com/accounts/signup) and verify the emailbefore logging in to the software.

   *	For those who did not create their Bdrive account IDs yet at the moment of adding them as a member, a **Verification Email with Temporary Password** will be emailed to log in with temporary password.  It is highly suggested to change the password in [**https://accounts.bdrive.com/accounts/password/reset**](https://accounts.bdrive.com/accounts/password/reset).

   *	Optionally, we assist to register multiple Team members using CSV file so write to our [**Support Site**](#wiki-toc-support-site) _(https://support.bdrive.com)_ with Team admin account ID and CSV file attached.

3. Assign license quantity for each added Team member.  By default, it is set to 1 per user and it can be changed anytime within available quantity.
