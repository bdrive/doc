**NetDrive3 License**
=====================

Each customer needs to Create Account ID in order to purchase and login to NetDrive3 software.  Unlike our previous versions, NetDrive3 does not use license number anymore and it always needs to be connected to the Internet while using. 

A trial version is available in [our web store](https://www.netdrive.net/store) _(https://www.netdrive.net/store)_ and it is recommended to check our software prior to the purchase.  

‘**License**’ is defined as the number of software that can be used concurrently in any device, and each customer can purchase as many licenses as needed.

Once the license purchase is successfully completed, no-reply confirmation email is immediately sent to user account ID along with the invoice link.


**Plans In General**
================

NetDrive3 has two kinds of plans, Personal and Team, which can be found in [our web store](http://www.netdrive.net/store). 

[‘**Personal plan**’](http://www.netdrive.net/store/store/#tab-1)  _(http://www.netdrive.net/store/store/#tab-1)_ is generally for personal use which allows only a single account ID whether customer purchases one or multiple licenses.  In case of multiple Personal licenses, same drive items are used among the devices and mounted drives/contents are accessible to other Windows users on the same device.

[‘**Team plan**’](http://www.netdrive.net/store/store/#tab-2)  _(http://www.netdrive.net/store/store/#tab-2)_ can have respective account ID for each Team member.  After the purchase, Team admin must **Add Team Member** in **Account Site**.  Unlike Personal plan, each Team member has their own drive items and mounted drives are not visible to other Windows users on the same devices.


**License Types**
=================

Two types of NetDrive3 licenses are available, subscription based and onetime purchase.

‘**Yearly Subscription**’ can use the license during subscription period along with customer support and update.  It is very important to know about the Subscription Auto-Renewal which will be auto-charged on the initial purchased day of next year, using the same payment method. 

‘**Lifetime License**’ literally can be used during product lifetime with selection of ‘support and update’ period, either 1 year or lifetime. 

In case of **‘1 year’ support and update option**, the license can be used for product lifetime with limited support and update of 1 year.  For the customers who further need support and update after 1 year expired, additional Lifetime Support Option is available.  Detailed information can be found in the article ['What happens to my one-time license after 1 year?'](https://support.bdrive.com/t/what-happens-to-my-one-time-license-after-1-year/92018).

In case of **‘lifetime’ support and update option**, the license will last during product lifetime along with support and update.

_Note that Personal plan offers both 1 year and lifetime support and update selection whereas Team plan offers lifetime only.

Note each account ID can purchase only one license type._


**Add License**
===============

License can be added to valid initial purchase order at add-license price.  The purchase can be proceeded in ‘License’ category of NetDrive3 account page, https://accounts.bdrive.com/plans_products/NetDrive3.  

When placing an add license order, the payment proceeds in two steps both applying prorate based on initial purchase day.  We first cancel the initial (or most recent) purchase order by partial refunding (prorate).  Then we issue a new purchase order for total license quantity (prorate).

Note support and update period of added licenses of Lifetime license for 1 year will comply with the license period of initial purchase order. 

Note yearly subscription allows both add and remove license option whereas lifetime license limits to add license with no remove option.


**Add Team Member**
===============
After the Team license purchase is completed, Team admin is required to add members before using the software.
There are 2 ways to add Team members and it can be proceeded in the following accounts page https://accounts.bdrive.com/plans_products/NetDrive3/team.

The basic way is to add Team members manually.  Within available license quantity, Team admin can manually add members and assign license quantity per member.  Note each of Team members need to Create their own Account IDs prior to add member procedure. 
 
For bulk licenses, however, it is more popular to use domain registering way.  Once the domain is successfully registered, any user under this domain can use the software after Create Account ID and email verification is completed. 

Once entire Team members are added, license quantity must be assigned to each of them.  Default license quantity is 1 and it can be managed in account site.  Team members can be changed in account site anytime.

We assist to add multiple Team members using CSV file, so write to our support site (https://support.bdrive.com) with CSV file and account ID.  

As a simple guide, Team Manual is emailed to Team admin account ID upon license purchase completion. 


**Team Manual**

A simple manual to Add Team Member can be downloaded in https://discourse.bdrive.com/t/team-manual-admin-member-control/40947.
