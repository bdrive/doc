###**Sync up**

{% include inline_image.html file="synchronize_1.jpg" max-width="200" %}

You can synchronize your disks, either local or in the cloud, by clicking the "SYNC NOW" button. It will return to "PREPARE" and then "SYNCING" while synchronizing the discs.

There are four sub-menus to select while not connected to a remote server.

- ** HISTORY **: Shows synchronization history by date.
- ** CONFIG **: Change the task settings.
- ** DELETE **: Deletes the current task.
- ** SYNC NOW **: Performs synchronization between disks, as specified in the task settings.
