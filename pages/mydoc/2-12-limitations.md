### File listing (WebDAV, FTP/FTPS/ SFTP)

For WebDAV, FTP/FTPS, SFTP protocols file list reloading from server will be blocked for a folder where files are being uploaded. File listing for other folders are working without any limits.

Because of this limitations, files uploaded to **the same folder** from other users will be shown when file uploading is finised.

### File system is not available (macOS)

When you cannot mount remote storage on macOS

NetDrive needs to register a virtual device for user to access virtual file systems. The number of available virtual device slots are limited by macOS. So if you are using other softwares that uses these device slots NetDrive will not be able to register its virtual device and it cannot connect to remote storages.

You can list currently registered virtual devices using following command.

    $ kextstat

It can list more than hundred devices registered to your system (YMMV).

Use following command to list only third party devices.

    $ kextstat | grep -v com.apple

You can unload kext using following command.

    $ sudo kextunload -b com.company.virtualfilesystem

After unload some kexts please install NetDrive again to register NetDrive virtual device.

### Locked files shown to be deleted (Windows)

From NetDrive 3.9 we supports file locking. Locked files cannot be overwritten, renamed or deleted. On Windows operating system when you try to delete locked file it is deleted and will disappear from Windows Explorer but actually the file is not removed from your server. After refresh or remount you can find your file again.

This is a known issue and we are looking for the solution.

### Failed to upgrade from 3.7 and below (Windows)

If you have problem when upgrading from NetDrive 3.7 and below please uninstall first and install recent version.
