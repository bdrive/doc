**Account Site**
============

Each customer needs to [**Create Account ID**](#wiki-toc-create-account-id) prior to purchase and login to NetDrive3 software.  Account Site is [**https://accounts.bdrive.com**](https://accounts.bdrive.com) and includes Login Information, [**Reset Password**](#wiki-toc-reset-password), [**Change Login Method**](#wiki-toc-change-login-method), [**Invoice Link**](#wiki-toc-invoice-link), [**Add License**](/wiki/netdrive/license#wiki-toc-add-license), [**Add Team Member**](/wiki/netdrive/license#wiki-toc-add-team-member), [**Support Site**](#wiki-toc-support-site), etc.




**Subscription Auto-Renewal**
=========================

Yearly Subscription continues yearly base by auto-charging on the initial purchase day of each successive year, using the same payment method.  A renewal order will be issued and emailed to user account ID.

User is required to check the expiration date of the credit card before annual auto-charge transaction is proceeded since otherwise it will fail the renewal which eventually leads to the cancellation of the entire subscription immediately.  Our customers will receive renewal notification email 7 days prior to the renewal date advising about upcoming auto-charge, so it is important to double check card information including the expiration date.  Change Credit Card is available in our payment gateway, BlueSnap.  

For any reason, if you need to stop yearly subscription, check [**End Subscription**](#wiki-toc-end-subscription) and [**Refund Policy**](#wiki-toc-refund-policy) first and then write to our [**Support Site**](#wiki-toc-support-site) _(https://support.bdrive.com)_ with account ID and transaction ID.




**Lifetime Support Option**
===========================

For lifetime license with support and update of 1 year expired, we additionally provide maintenance renewal option, either 1 year or lifetime.  The renewal can be proceeded in [**https://accounts.bdrive.com/plans_products/NetDrive3/extend_support**](https://accounts.bdrive.com/plans_products/NetDrive3/extend_support) anytime.  

If purchased multiple license quantities, the lifetime support option can only be applied to the entire licenses as a whole.  Remove license or support purchase for part of the licenses is not available.




**Create Account ID**
=================

Prior to purchase or login to NetDrive3, every customer needs to create their own Bdrive account ID and set password in [**https://accounts.bdrive.com/accounts/signup**](https://accounts.bdrive.com/accounts/signup).  This account ID is required to be verified (in the email sent) before using the software.  This account ID is primary identification we use to send email verification, license confirmation, support contact, renewal notification, etc.

**Change Account ID**
=================

We assist to transfer current license to a new account ID.  Prior to the transfer, this new account ID needs to be created in [**Create Account ID**](#wiki-toc-create-account-id).  This transfer simply changes the user account ID, and the original information (card holder and address) remains fixed.

When transferring the license, we handle the entire licenses under current account ID as a whole, meaning that we do not transfer part of the licenses.  Also, it is not possible to transfer to an account ID that already has paid licenses.
