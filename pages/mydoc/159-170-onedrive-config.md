When you complete the authentication using your OneDrive account, OneDrive will be ready for any task that you create as ORIGIN or DESTINATION of your data. You will then see the "SYNC NOW", "CANCEL", "OPTIONS" and "BROWSE" buttons in the CloudSync Application.


OPTIONS
==================
You can control the bandwidth used by clicking "OPTIONS".
