CONNECT
==================
Choose Local disk from FROM and/or TO, and then click CONNECT to associate the account with the synchronization task.

After connecting the disc, press the BROWSE button and from the pop-up screen select the folder of your local disk that you wish to synchronize.

{% include inline_image.html file="localdisk_config_2.jpg" max-width="200" %}

Local disk will be ready for any task that you create as ORIGIN or DESTINATION of your data. You will then see the "SYNC NOW", "CANCEL", "OPTIONS" and "BROWSE" buttons in the CloudSync Application.
