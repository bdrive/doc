# NetDrive

NetDrive connects storage servers like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, WebDAV and FTP server, etc. It allows Windows and Mac users to manage files and folders on a storage server as they were located on your PC’s local drive, using a simple drag and drop process.

## Partnership

We offer NetDrive to software vendors and service providers through our OEM license program. Since NetDrive can be easily customized and integrated into existing software products or services, it will enable software developers to add a powerful OS integration without any significant investment on development.
